ok, so now the next goal is getting a shell working.

In order to do that, I'm going to want to have a ton of stuff
 * processes
 * filesystem
 * syscalls

I've already got a version of input/output with ps2/terminal, so we should be
fine on that end.

Filesystems are just an abstraction on disks (and in unix, a few others). 
According to OSDev, the main Driver interface for disks is ATA, so thats next
on the study list

Also, loopback devices should allow us have a harddrive without breaking our current disk, I think using on of those would make a lot of sense.

Ok, so loopback devices work best with floopy devices, floppies have a good 
amount of documentation on the osdev wiki, so I think that I'm first going to 
write a Floppy Disk Controller (if I run out of space for floppies, I'll be so 
far down the line that a ATA/SATA driver will be more resonable

Yeah, the ATA drivers are a directory in linux, floppy.c is a single file. We'll
start with floppies.
