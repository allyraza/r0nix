in the everlasting hunt to figure where I broke interrupts, I've found
that interrupts cause a triple fault. Now just to find where I can fix them...

I looked at the code-base of qemu, and It found that exceptions are caused
by the following if in the code base (@ target-i386/seg_helper.c)

if (!(e2 & DESC_S_MASK) || !(e2 & (DESC_CS_MASK))) {
	raise_exception_err(env, EXCP0D_GPF, selector & 0xfffc);
}

K, interrupts are now (finally) working. 

Up next is to reprogram the pic. I want to get the APIC working, so I Have to
Disable the PIC first, and figure out what else To do.

actually, we'll add PIC support first because theres more resources, then
we'll work on apic support stuff.
