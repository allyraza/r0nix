In protected mode, the Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures provide a protection 
mechanism that operates at both the segment level and the page level. This 
protection mechanism provides the ability to limit access to certain segments
or pages based on privilege levels.

Critical operating-system code and data can be protected by placing them in
more privileged segments then those containing applications code. 

When the protection mechanism is used, each memory reference is checked to 
verify that it satisfies various protection checks. All checks are made before 
the memory cycle is started; any violation results in an exception. Because
checks are performed in parallel with address translation, there is no 
performance penalty. The protection checks that are performed fall into the
following categories:
	* limit checks
	* type checks
	* Privilege level checks.
	* Restriction of addressable domain.
	* Restriction of procedure entry-points.
	* Restriction of instruction set.
