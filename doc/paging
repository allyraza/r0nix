_Paging_ (or linear-address translation) is the process of translating linear
addresses so that they can be used to access memory or I/O devices.

Paging translates each linear address to a _physical address_ and determines,
for each translation, what accesses to the linear address are allowed 
(the address's _access rights_) and the type of caching used for such 
accesses(the address's _memory type_).


Paging behavior is contolled by the following control bits:
~	The WP and PG flags in control register CR0
~	The PSE, PAE, PGE, PCIDE, SMEP, and SMAP flags in control register CR4
~	The LME and NXE flags in the IA32_EFER MSR
~	The AC flag in the EFLAGS register (bit 18).

Software enables paging by using the MOV to CR0 instruction to set CR0.pg.
Before doing so, software should ensure that control register CR3 contains
the physical address of the first paging structure that the processor will
use for linear-address translation and that structure is initalized as desired.

There are three different paging modes, but we will just use 32bit.

Hierarchial paging structures
-----------------------------
All three paging modes translate linear addresses use _hierarchial paging structures_. 

Every paging structure is 4096 bytes in size and comprises a number of 
individual _entries_. With 32-bit paging, each entry is 32 bits; there are 
thus 1024 entries in each structure.

The processor uses the upper portion of a linear address to identify a series 
of paging-structure entries. The last of these entries identifies the 
physical address of the region to which the linear address translates (called
the _page frame_). The lower portion of the linear address (called the 
_page offset_) identifies the specific address within that region to which
the linear address translates.

Each paging-structure entry contains a physical address, which is either the
address of another paging structure or the address of a page frame. In the 
first case, the entry is said to _reference_ the other paging structure;
in the latter, the entry is said to _map a page_.
