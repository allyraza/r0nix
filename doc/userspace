In order to get to a shell, we need a user space. 
Ordinarily we would do this through paging, but for now we can simply give it
its own address space, and be careful with the programs we run on it.

(we should go for paging at some point, however)

We should use elf files (because there is no good reason not to), and then
look into how exactly we should go about parsing them.
