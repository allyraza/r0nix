The local APIC is controlled by the APIC enable bit (AE) in the APIC Base
Adress Register.

When AE is set to 1, the local APIC is enabled and all interrupt types are 
accepted. When AE is cleared to 0, the local APIC is disabled, including all
local vector table interrupts.

Software can disable the local APIC, using the APIC_SW_EN bit in the Spurious
Interrupt Vector Register (APIC_F0). When this bit is cleared to zero, the 
local APIC is temporarily disabled:
 * SMI,NMI,INIT,Startup, and Remote Read interrupts may be accepted.
 * Pending interrupts in the ISR and IRR are head.
 * Further fixed, lowest-priority, and ExINT interrupts are not accepted.
 * All LVT entry mask bits are set and connot be cleared.
