The system programming interface of the local APIC is made up of the registers
listed in Table 16-2 below. All APIC registers are memory-mapped into the 
4-Kbyte APIC register space, and are accessed with memory reads and writes.
The memory address is indicated as:
	
	APUIC Register address = APIC Base Address + Offset

where the APIC Base Adress must point to an uncacheable memory region, and is
located in APIC Base Address Register, MSR 0000_001Bh. 

APIC registers are aligned to 16-byte offsets and must be accessed using DWORD
size read and writes. All other accesses cause undefined behavior.
