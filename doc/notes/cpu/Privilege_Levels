Privilege levels provide a security mechanism at the CPU level; they are often 
interpreted as rings, with ring 0 being the most permissive.

from 64-32intel_manual:
"
The IA-32 architecture's protection mechanism recognizes four privilege levels,
numbered from 0 to 3, where a greater number means less privilege. The reason
to use privilege levels is to improve the reliability of operating systems.
