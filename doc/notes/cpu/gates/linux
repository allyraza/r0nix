Ok, let's take a peek at how linux does this.

tracked down the relevent code to arch/x86 (go figure)

the lidt instruction for linux can be found in arch/x86/kernel/head_32.S

also, relvant comment from the linux source:

/*
 * The IDT and GDT 'descriptors' are a strange 48-bit object only used by
 * the lidt and lgdt instructions. They are not like usual segment descriptors-
 * they consist of a 16-bit segment size, and 32-bit linear address value.
 */

There are also relevant structs for descriptors in arch/x86/include/desc_defs.h 
and arch/x86/include/desc.h
