Ok, our interrupt handler, let's plan that out.

For starters, we'll just have something that calls a C function, which prints
out something like 'INTERRUPT'. We'll call that function iprint.

To do that we need to setup our IDT to all go to iprint.

To do that, we need to figure out exactly what each entry of the IDT table
should look like. Then we implement each entry in a IDT table, then we tell the
cpu what out IDT is with the LIDT instruction.
