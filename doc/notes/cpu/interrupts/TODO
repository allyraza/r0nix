ok, so the osdev wiki has a little section on how to program interrupts,
which basically goes like this:

	[x] make space for the interrupt descriptor table
	[x] Tell the CPU where that space is (lidt)
	[WIP] Tell the PIC that you no longer want to use the BIOS defaults
	[] Write a couple of ISR handlers for both IRQs and exceptions
	[] Put the addresses of the ISR handlers in the appropriate descriptors
	[] Enable all supported interrupts in the IRQ mask (of the PIC)
