RDMSR - Read from Model Specific Register

Read the MSR specified by ECX into EDX:EAX.

The EDX register is loaded with the high-order 32 bits of the MSR and the EAX
register is loaded with the low-order 32 bits. If fewer than 64 bits are 
implemented in the MSR being read, the values returned to EDX:EAX in 
unimplemented bit locations are undefined.
