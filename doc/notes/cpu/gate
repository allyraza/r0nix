from 64-32intel_manual:
"
Code modules in lower privilege segments can only access modules operating at
higher privilege segments by means of a tightly controlled and protected 
interface called a gate. Attempts to access higher privilege segments without
going through a protection gate and without having sufficient access rights
causes a general-protection exception (#GP) to be generated.

if an operating system or executive uses this multilevel protection mechanism,
a call to a procedure that is in a more privileged protection level than the 
calling procedure is handled in a similar manner as a far call;with a few 
differences /*...*/
