Ok, now that we can read a file from the disk, lets see about getting our
program up and running.

Hmm, because our OS will have its own syscalls, we will need to let our 
compiler know that...

To the wiki!

Ok, so the best way to do this is to write a standard C library, to link with
the compiler. 

We already link with a kernel version, so actually, writing a C library 
shouldn't be too hard at all, as it's simply a wrapper around syscalls.
