ok, so now the next goal is getting a shell working.

In order to do that, I'm going to want to have a ton of stuff
 [-] filesystem
 [-] processes
 [X] syscalls

Filesystems:
-----------
[X] open
[X] close
[-] read /* indirect pointers not finished */
[ ] write /*only writes to stdout*/

Processes:
---------
[X] kexec
[ ] fork()
[ ] userspace exec

Syscalls:
---------
/* The syscalls are there, not neccecarily the things behind them */
[X] open
[X] close
[X] read
[X] write
[X] fork
[X] execve
