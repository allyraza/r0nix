Filesystems are just an abstraction on disks (and in unix, a few others). 
According to OSDev, the main Driver interface for disks is ATA, so thats next
on the study list

Also, loopback devices should allow us have a harddrive without breaking our current disk, I think using on of those would make a lot of sense.

Ok, so loopback devices work best with floopy devices, floppies have a good 
amount of documentation on the osdev wiki, so I think that I'm first going to 
write a Floppy Disk Controller (if I run out of space for floppies, I'll be so 
far down the line that a ATA/SATA driver will be more resonable

Yeah, the ATA drivers are a directory in linux, floppy.c is a single file. We'll
start with floppies.

...actually, I don't think were going to run out of memory at all if we just
use ramdisks for a while. Thats what the osdevwiki Lino Commando uses, I really
don't see why I shouldn't. The ram I have is more then enough, so we'll just
use that till we need more.

Yeah, we'll define a common interface between all block devices so that we can
just use that everywhere else, so that the drivers are just specific, and 
the kernel will interact through the interface.
