Filesystems are just an abstraction on disks (and in unix, a few others). 

We're going to be using ext2, simply because its a linux classic, and im 
already using ext4.

Ok, so how are we going to handle the open syscall?

It hands us a path, and we have to find the inode based on that path.

We start at the root directory, then we search for each part of the directory 
path, steping through the inodes along the way.

Ok, we've got enough of the ext2 done, now we need to improve our vfs
